# bus-management-system
System used to buy bus tickets for a desired route.

This is a client-server project, where a client can buy tickets for a desired hour and route. The client must get in his account, if he has not one, he must register, and then he can make as much reservations as he want to. Also, there is an admin side, where the administrator can make CRUD operations on drivers, buses, clients, routes.
